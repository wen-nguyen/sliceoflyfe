        <p>I've read Le Guin's article one or twice before, but it's always a good read. I'm reminded again the appreciation for the simple or basic things that we utilize in everyday life that are considered "lo-tech". For whatever reason, I really appreciated the paper comparison--it's probably one of the most simplist forms of technology that I know, but it's a lot that goes into it, just the same as a handmade website. As primative anything seems, it's all technology. That thought alone makes me feel more appreciative of everything around me. 

        Schwulst's piece makes me a little more reflective of what websites can be. I had always seen in, or at least the majority of it, being used to be serve a bigger body (attention, time, money, sales), which is fine by all means--it's just mostly what I saw. My boss, after me telling him that I was taking web design, jokingly told me that I could use what I've learned to help create the company website. In a way, I could, but this line of thinking of a website just as a space is much different than what he's expecting. Imagining a website as a ~space~, comparing it to a physical area, a website just equates to a an emppty room where you could put whatever you wanted into it. It's also strange to think of it as something tangibly intangible. Probably reaching with that one, though.

        It's becoming more apparent how much more of a "craft" website building is then previously thought. The assumption already was to use presets and templates and learn composition or what typeface goes best with what for corporate use. It's what I've thought of it my entire educational career. But clarifying what consists of handmade objects basically makes it so that website building is on the same level conceptually as sewing a quilt together. It's even more compelling to me to now, for the first time, that I can see websites as an art piece.
        <br>
        It's also interesting comparing websites to a 3D or tangible object, when I've always seen it as 2D flat spaces on a screen, just moveable on different screens. Now I imagine it more like a room, and you can decorate it however you want. As of late, now it feels more like a store with a whole bunch of stuff it's trying to sell you. With those kinds of spaces, you don't really get consent with what you see. Some overstimulating to the point where I can compare it to TikTok. In your own space, however, it's whatever you want it to be.

        From the random explosion of the Bitcoin and NFT stuff, I had a small idea of the amount of physical space they require. To be honest, I didn't really believe it (I found that information off of Twitter) because it didn't make that much sense to me how something that I can describe as basically "untangible" take up space? You're telling me that these things and servers take up acres of land? It's like telling me ghosts are real lol. But learning about it a little more in our class discussion, it feels ironic (paradox, as Aidan put it). Hard to believe that AI servers require water?? Of course us humans manage to make it so that a space that's virtual still is environmentally unstable. But of course the more I think about it, it does make sense because I literally use that kind of stuff all the time. The only one my brain can conjure up right now are hard drives lol. 

        In a way, I guess how we store information just changed. I referenced Margaret Hamilton, the computer scientist that wrote the code that sent a rocket to the moon. The code took thousands of pages, the stack literally her height! It went from that to us now storing information that infomation in different ways. 
        
        It makes the online consumerism world a lot less appealling learning about this, to be quite honest. But also, I'm still addicted. Additionally, I hope more of the world knows about the physical internet space. Would it help people deter from using those too? I'm thinking pessimistically because I don't trust humans to always do the right thing sometimes or make choices for its own wellbeing (that's a whole other conversation), but if we blow this shit up even louder, maybe it can make a dent.
