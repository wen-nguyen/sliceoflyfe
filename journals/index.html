        <p>I've read Le Guin's article one or twice before, but it's always a good read. I'm reminded again the appreciation for the simple or basic things that we utilize in everyday life that are considered "lo-tech". For whatever reason, I really appreciated the paper comparison--it's probably one of the most simplist forms of technology that I know, but it's a lot that goes into it, just the same as a handmade website. As primative anything seems, it's all technology. That thought alone makes me feel more appreciative of everything around me. 

        Schwulst's piece makes me a little more reflective of what websites can be. I had always seen in, or at least the majority of it, being used to be serve a bigger body (attention, time, money, sales), which is fine by all means--it's just mostly what I saw. My boss, after me telling him that I was taking web design, jokingly told me that I could use what I've learned to help create the company website. In a way, I could, but this line of thinking of a website just as a space is much different than what he's expecting. Imagining a website as a ~space~, comparing it to a physical area, a website just equates to a an emppty room where you could put whatever you wanted into it. It's also strange to think of it as something tangibly intangible. Probably reaching with that one, though.

        It's becoming more apparent how much more of a "craft" website building is then previously thought. The assumption already was to use presets and templates and learn composition or what typeface goes best with what for corporate use. It's what I've thought of it my entire educational career. But clarifying what consists of handmade objects basically makes it so that website building is on the same level conceptually as sewing a quilt together. It's even more compelling to me to now, for the first time, that I can see websites as an art piece.

        It's also interesting comparing websites to a 3D or tangible object, when I've always seen it as 2D flat spaces on a screen, just moveable on different screens. Now I imagine it more like a room, and you can decorate it however you want. As of late, now it feels more like a store with a whole bunch of stuff it's trying to sell you. With those kinds of spaces, you don't really get consent with what you see. Some overstimulating to the point where I can compare it to TikTok. In your own space, however, it's whatever you want it to be.
